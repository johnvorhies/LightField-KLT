# LightField-KLT
LightField-KLT is a Matlab library to implement and test the performance of the 4-D Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) for light field image compression. This library uses the GPU functionality of Matlab to compute the 4-D KLT on NVidia GPUs. If multiple GPUs are available, simultaneous executions of the 4-D KLT can be performed.
